Our History
Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba was once described as a fusion between "tradition and vision". Let this host of stories unfold as a testimony to that 
contradictory blend.

The Colegio's Historical Records
Its story started in March 1979 when it was founded by its mother-institution, Letran Intramuros. It is the first institution of higher learning established 
by the Dominican Province of the Philippines; the rest having been put up by the Spanish Dominicans.

The idea of putting up a Dominican school in Laguna was triggered by the move to decentralize DPPI schools in Manila. Further, a close consideration was also 
that of bringing Letran to another home place of a hero - our national icon: Dr. Jose Rizal.

Letran Manila was touted as the alma mater of our great heroes such as Manuel Quezon, Sergio Osme√±a, Apolinarion Mabini, Gregorio del Pilar, Fransisco Balagtas, 
and Emilio Aguinaldo. From 1979, Letran Calamba has established a good name in quality education, strong research efforts, and responsive community service and 
extension activities. Hence, in 1986, it was granted autonomy by Letran Manila. It has since become a respected higher educational institution. It operates within 
the principles of Filipino, Dominican, and Christian education - within the contexts of excellence, conscience, and discipline. Its curricular programs range from 
its flagship engineering courses to specialized offerings on information technology, business management, hospitality management, education, arts and sciences, 
nursing, and professional studies.

The Here and Now
For the last decades, the Colegio can boast of accomplishments in quality learning and instruction, infrastructure development, research undertakings, and 
community service. The institution has a pool of more than 250 qualified mentors, most of them equipped with graduate degrees. Engineering and communication 
students manage the institution's own radio station, Knight 103.9 FM. Hotel and Restaurant Management students operate fully equipped mini-hotel in the campus. 
Computer Science and Information Technology majors, on the other hand, enjoys the use of the Information Technology and Computer Center, a facility provided with 
700 top-of-the-line computer units. Research efforts were rewarded with CHED Region IV's award for the best HEI Student Research Program given January 2007. 
Community Service is felt through the tradition and advocacy of Makipamuhay, a social immersion program being sustained by the Colegio for years. It has also 
put up Hayuma an internationally-funded project where skilled workers from Laguna communities are working.

Our Routes
All these and more triggered the Colegio to venture into accreditation and certification efforts. These are moves to further substantiate the institution's adherence 
to quality standards. This is another part of our institution's grand narrative.

The Colegio has pursued various quality management efforts reflecting the institution's drive towards management of quality assurance. Letran Calamba has started 
its application for Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) accreditation in November 2008. The Federation 
of Accrediting Association of the Philippines (FAAP) awarded to 50% of the Colegio's program LEVEL I Formal Status and 18.18% of the programs with Level 
II First Reaccredited Status. The Colegio was also awarded with the highest number of candidate programs in the Philippines for two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). 
In addition, the Colegio has been awarded as the institution with the highest number of Level 1 accredited programs in the Philippines during the 
25th PACUCOA General Assembly.

Also, the Colegio was granted the ISO 9001:2008 certification on November 28, 2013. The Colegio's pursuit of quality management continues with its recent 
engagement with a national quality award. The quality management efforts of the Colegio prove the contention that quality is a continuous and rigorous pursuit 
which is worth doing well.

Symbols

Seal of the Colegio
The Seal bears the Maltese Cross derived from the Knights of Malta, whose pious works earned for themselves a place of honor within the Church. 
The silver Cross, on a blue and red field encircled by a wreath of green laurels, symbolizes the pattern by which the spirit must grow - 
the silver purity of true and noble goals alone can triumph over difficulties; victory follows with a wreath of laurels.

The Seal also bears another symbol of the Colegio, her motto: DEUS, PATRIA, LETRAN; which embodies the Letranite's manner of offering deeds - 
to God first, the Country next, and Letran where his ideals are born.

Knighthood
The Letranite is personified by the Knight who goes through rigid tests from being a Page to a Squire when his heart and soul are many times tested for 
purity before he qualifies for the most trying challenge and then granted knighthood. As a knight, he carries the shield and the lance to protect not his 
body but his ideals as he fights for them with a pure heart.

The shield which carries the Silver Cross on a blue and red field encircled by a wreath of green laurels symbolizes the pattern by which the spirit must grow - 
the silver purity of true and noble goals alone can triumph over difficulties; victory follows with a wreath of laurels.

Blue and Red Colors
Blue stands for loyalty and justice and Red is for consummate bravery. The colors of Letran are Blue and red, not red and blue, symbolize that the nobility of 
the mind and the spirit should come before the bravery and courage are fired by a cause.
